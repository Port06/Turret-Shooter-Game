I'm a begginer with c++ projects, so I cannot provide a guide to download the project.
If you manage to do so, you will find yourself with a template of a Turret Shooter Game (curently only the menu, and very soon some code).
I would apreciate very much any kind of feedback about bugs or simple improvements that would make it even better!
Thanks for taking your time to look at this.

PS: I believe you have to put the file in "Users/User/source/repos"
